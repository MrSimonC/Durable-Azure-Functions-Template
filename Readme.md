# Durable Azure Functions Template

This project template is your starting block for using the latest patterns in Azure Durable Functions.

Use this project as a starting point for a new project involving Durable Functions, or as a reference for a working example of:

* Azure Functions using .Net Core 3.1
* Durable Orchestration (*Durable Functions 1.0*)
* Durable Entities (*Durable Functions 2.1*)

At time of writing, Visual Studio will create you appropriate Azure Functions templates, but not if you plan to use the latest nuget packages (e.g. when upgrading to Durable Functions 2.1, name changes in orchestrator functions haven't been updated in the standard Visual Studio orchestration template).
